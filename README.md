# Image Segmentation Application

This is a Streamlit-based application that performs image segmentation using the DeeplabV3 model from MediaPipe. The app allows users to upload images and segment them into different categories using a deep learning model (`deeplab_v3.tflite`).

## Features

- Upload images (JPG, PNG, JPEG, WEBP).
- Segments images based on predefined categories (using DeeplabV3).
- Visualize the segmented image.
- Option to apply effects such as Gaussian blur on non-segmented areas.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Streamlit
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe
- Numpy
